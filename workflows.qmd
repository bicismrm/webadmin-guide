## Site Map

## Global Elements

### Header and Footer

::: callout-important
The header and footer are maintained by the ISMRM central office.
:::

![ISMRM Header (January 2026)](img/ismrm-header-2026Jan.png)

![ISMRM Footer (January 2026)](img/ismrm-footer-2026Jan.png)

- Minor customisations to the header and footer are allowed in principle, but the core styling must remain intact.
- **The section under the “BIC Menu” is editable.** Any proposed changes should be reviewed in coordination with the ISMRM central office to ensure compliance with the core styling.

### Navigation Bar

::: callout-important
The chapter navigation bar is maintained by the ISMRM central office.
:::

The navigation bar replicates the **BIC Menu** in the [Header section](#header-and-footer) to provide easy access to chapter pages.

![Chapter's navigation bar (January 2026)](img/chapter-navbar-2026Jan.png)

- The navigation bar is **not sticky**, i.e., it does not remain fixed while scrolling.
- On narrow screens or mobile devices, the navigation bar collapses into a **hamburger menu** (&#8801;).
- Any proposed changes should be reviewed in coordination with the ISMRM central office to ensure compliance with the core styling.

## Bylaws

-   The Chapter’s bylaws are revised by the Executive Committee. Final approval and ratification typically occur at the Chapter’s Annual Meeting.\
-   The official version of the bylaws is hosted on the Chapter’s website (WordPress). Previous versions are archived under the ISMRM site (`ismrm.org/british/`). Queries for archived copies can be directed to the ISMRM IT & Web Coordinator.

1.  After ratification, the Chapter President (or designated officer) prepares the final PDF.\
2.  Upload the PDF to the website’s media library and copy the URL for the newly uploaded version.\
3.  Update the link on the Chapter’s website to point to the latest version.\
4.  **Do not delete old versions**, as this may cause other links to break.

## Landing Page

### Announcements

The most common type of announcement is the Chapter’s Annual Meeting.

::: callout-important
Dates and venues for pre-conference workshops may differ from the main meeting and should be clearly highlighted to avoid confusion.
:::

1.  Confirm key details with the annual meeting organiser, including:

-   Meeting dates\
-   Venue information\
-   Any pre-conference workshops\
-   The dedicated meeting website, usually hosted by the organising institution

2.  Draft an announcement for the meeting chair to review and approve.

-   Keep the content brief and concise.
-   signpost visitors to the dedicated meeting website for further details and updates.

### Featured Education Talks

This section on the landing page contains:

-   A hyperlink to the [MR Education Series](https://bic.ismrm.org/mr-education-series/) page.
-   A media slider displaying cover images from recent education talks.

::: callout-note
For instructions on maintaining the MR Education Series page, see [MR Education Series](#mr-education-series).
:::

Please follow the steps below to update the media slides on the landing page.

1.  Use your browser’s **Developer Tools** to locate the cover image element and the corresponding Vimeo video link for the new education talk.

2.  Save a copy of the cover image offline. Rename the image file using the following convention:\
    `mr-education-{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}-cover` The following snippet may be useful to serve as a template for this workflow:

    ```         
    Image x
    mr-education-{YYYY}-{MM}-{DD}-cover
    URL: https://player.vimeo.com/video/<vimeo-id>
    ```

3.  Upload the cover image to the media library.

4.  In the media slides element, create a duplicate of an existing media slide entry.

5.  Replace the existing image with the new cover image.

6.  Update the embedded video URL with the correct Vimeo link.

### Newsletters

The official name for our chapter's newsletter is **Positive Spin**. A hyperlink is displayed on the first line for subscribing to the newsletter, followed by a static image showing the table of contents for the current issue, and a hyperlink to the [Newsletter Archive](https://us14.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=1c9cc503b3f3f5c9fe4e18b16&id=13766ba6dd) at the bottom of the section.

:::

Each time a new issue is released:

3.  Replace the existing image with the updated screenshot.
