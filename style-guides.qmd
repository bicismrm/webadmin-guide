This page provides detailed guidance on the written style used across our chapter's website. The purpose is to ensure consistency in tone, terminology and formatting, while promoting inclusive and accessible content throughout.

## Writing

These guiding principles aim to ensure written content remains clear, accessible, and user-focused:

-   **Write for scanning**: Online readers tend to scan rather than read every word. On average, they read about only 20% of the text on a page.
-   **User-oriented**: Write content that helps visitors to quickly and easily complete the specific tasks they come for.
-   **Use plain language**: Keep language simple and direct to make information easy to understand and accessible to all users.
-   **Guide the reader**: Use clear headings, signposts, and answer unasked questions to make content more engaging and relevant.
-   **Highlight key information**: Place important messages at the top of the page to capture visitor's attention.
-   **Use credible sources**: Provide accurate information and support with authoritative references to to back up the content and build trust.
