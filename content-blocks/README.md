# Content Blocks

This directory contains reusable text and code blocks used across the Chapter website.

These blocks act as the source of truth for shared elements such as announcements, awards, newsletters, and the MR education series.

To avoid inconsistencies, update these blocks as they evolve and do not duplicate them elsewhere.
